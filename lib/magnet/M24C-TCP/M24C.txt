NAME
	CCM24C - LabView driver for the Cryocon Model 24C temperature controller
		using the Ethernet, RS232 and IEEE-488 interface.
		       *****LabView 14*****

DESCRIPTION
	The Model 24C is a four-channel cryogenic temperature controller with
	serial (RS-232), Ethernet and GPIB (IEEE-488.2) remote interfaces. These drivers
	support all of the interfaces using the 'Visa' connection method.
